# Business-Data-Management-project
This repository contains the details of my Capstone Project as part of the Business Data Management (BDM) course in the IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications program. This project provided me with hands-on experience in applying data management and analysis skills to solve real-world business problems.

### Project Overview
The BDM Capstone Project is an independent research initiative where students are expected to engage with a business, identify their challenges, collect and analyze primary data, and provide valuable, data-driven insights to aid decision-making. This involves working with both organized sectors (e.g., manufacturing, IT, and automobile industries) and unorganized sectors (e.g., small retailers, vegetable vendors). The primary objective is to:

i) Identify business issues through discussions with stakeholders.

ii) Collect, clean, and analyze raw business data.

iii) Offer actionable recommendations based on findings.

iv) Document and justify the approach and results in a professional report.

### Project Details
For this project, I collaborated with Mullick Filling Station, a dealership business under Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). I engaged directly with the business owner to understand their challenges. Through discussions, I identified key issues, which were primarily linked to the need for demand-driven strategies to improve operational efficiency and product sales.

To address these challenges:

#### Data Collection:
i) I gathered sales data for a specific period, as provided by the business owner.

ii) Conducted a market research survey to understand customer preferences.

#### Data Analysis:
i) Cleaned and organized the data for analysis.

ii) Identified trends, patterns, and correlations to uncover insights.

#### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, I provided actionable recommendations to address the identified issues.
Proposed strategies focused on better workforce management and increasing sales of a less sold fuel product.

### Outcome
The business owner was highly impressed with the findings and recommendations. My insights offered practical solutions to implement demand-driven strategies. The experience of solving a real-world business problem and working with raw data was immensely fulfilling.

### Conclusion
This project enhanced my ability to handle real-world data, identify actionable insights, and present findings in a professional manner. It underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making and demonstrated how thoughtful analysis can deliver tangible benefits to a business.

All details, including the organizationâ€™s background, challenges, data analysis, and recommendations, are documented in the project report. This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the entire process and its outcomes.
